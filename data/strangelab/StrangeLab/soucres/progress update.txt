# StrangeLab Status Update — 2026-02-03

## Network / IP Reservations

### pi-logger
- eth0 (wired): 192.168.8.160
- wlan0 (2.4GHz): 192.168.8.169
- Routing preference: eth0 metric 50, wlan0 metric 300

### pi-aux
- wifi0 (2.4GHz): 192.168.8.140
- wifi1 (5GHz): 192.168.8.114
- Routing preference goal: prefer 5GHz for default route; keep 2.4GHz as fallback.

## Services

### pi-logger
- Enabled + running:
  - strange-vault-ingest.service
- Bluetooth:
  - present but soft-blocked (expected if unused)

### pi-aux
- Enabled + running:
  - strangelab-aux-scanner.service

## BLE Scanner Status (pi-aux)

### What’s working
- strangelab-aux-scanner.service starts and stays running.
- Manual scanner runs successfully and writes events.

### What’s NOT working (current problem)
- Under systemd, btmgmt is repeatedly exiting with rc=1.
- events.ndjson is not growing (line count stays constant).

### Evidence
- systemd status shows repeated:
  - "[ble_scan] btmgmt exited rc=1; restarting in 1s"
- `wc -l /opt/strange/aux/events.ndjson` does not increase over time.

## Next Actions (to lock in BLE)
1) Capture btmgmt error output under systemd context.
2) Ensure bluetooth is Powered: yes and rfkill is unblocked.
3) If needed: add ExecStartPre to power on bluetooth via bluetoothctl.
4) Confirm events.ndjson grows continuously while service runs.
5) Add SSH keys for passwordless admin access.
